# Bézier playground

[Bézier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) playground.

## Dependencies
* OpenGL

## Usage
* Right-click and hold a control point to move it.
* Left-click on the left-most control point of a curve to delete it (a minimum of 2 curves would remain)/
* Left-click on the left-most _inner_ control point of a curve: imagine a line between that point and the left-most control point. The right-most control point of the curve to the left would reposition to that line.
* Middle-click and hold inside a curve's convex hull to move the curve in the XY plane.
* Right-click in a curve's convex hull to split it in half.
* Left-click in a curve's convex hull to transform the curve to a straight line.
* Zoom-in\out when moving the mouse up\down while right-clicking outside of some curve's' convex hull.
* Press `d` to create a [Bézier surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_surface) from the curve. Moving the mouse while right-clicking translates the scene, and while left-clicking would rotate it around the respective axes.
* Press the number keys to change the number of inner control points in the curves. This would also reset the scene.
* `esc` to exit.
